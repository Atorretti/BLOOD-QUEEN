## About

"Blood Queen" was developed during the fourth week of my bootcamp at <Academia de Código_>, as part of the Games Week event. Despite having only a basic understanding of Java, we were introduced to a library called Simple Graphics, which we used to create this vampire-themed platform game.

In "Blood Queen," you take on the role of a powerful vampire queen. Your mission is to navigate the treacherous platforms, find and feast upon the humans that spawn randomly on the map, all while managing your decreasing health points.

## Features

- Platform-style gameplay
- Vampire character with unique abilities
- Randomly spawning humans as targets
- Health management mechanics

## Libraries Used

- [Simple Graphics](https://github.com/academia-de-codigo/simple-graphics) - A library provided by <Academia de Código_> for creating graphical games in Java.
